### How to get everything to work:
- Launch Docker Desktop
- Start the class image.
- Connect to the image terminal.
- Clone the repo.
- cd into the new directory for the repo.
- Run 'make'.

### What issues I ran into:
- Cloning the repo from Windows downloaded the files with the wrong line endings.
    - To fix I should clone from within the Docker image.
