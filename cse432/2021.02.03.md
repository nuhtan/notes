__Main Steps of the ML Process (Continuation)__
- Machine Learning is trying to predict something.
    - Potentially unethical predictions.
        - Predicting Death
            - Predicting mostly adds trauma, little benefits.
        - Healthcare related topics
        - Trying to fill in answers to topics that a person filling out a survey chose not answer or refused to answer.
        - Invading privacy can easily cause trauma.
- After the Machine Learning comes the evaluation.
    - Very fast.
    - Generally an empirical affair.
    - Lots of tweaking to get more accurate results.
    - If the evaluation does not work out you might need to revise your data.
        - Maybe the goal needs to be revised.
            - It might be overly detailed.
    - Might need to modify the prediction.
    - Might need to gather more or better data.
