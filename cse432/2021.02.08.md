- What are tasks? What can we predict?
    - Unsupervised Learning
        - The target outcome is not defined.
        - Dimensionality Reduction
        - Clustering
    - Reinforcement Learning
    - Supervised Learning
        - Classification
        - Regression
    - Tasks should at least be partially automatic.
    - Machine learning automatically or semi-automatically builds models that use sizable datasets to discover hidden patterns.
    - Sub-fields based on:
        - scale
        - applications domain
        - data type
    - Clustering
        - Forming groups based on similarity.
    - Association Rule Learning
    - Causation
    - Classification
        - Predict a category or number based on the features.
        - Regression predicts a number where as classification gives a class as output.
    - Computers are taught by examples.
        - This is a part of supervised learning.
        - Training set that is manually determined beforehand.
        - In unsupervised learning the training set is not labeled beforehand.
